            <h2>What It Is</h2>
            <p>StudyPlanner was born from a simple idea: students need one simple, reliable place to manage everything. We were tired of juggling different apps, notebooks, and scattered calendars. We wanted a single, focused tool that brings your subjects, assignments, and schedule together in one place.</p>
            <p>It's designed to be your central hub for all your academic work—nothing more, nothing less.</p>
